### Other excellent resources:

Apart from the material posted in the [schedule](schedule.html) page, you can also refer to the following end-to-end resources.

- Incredibly accesible ground-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGZ6BttHMPw&list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH">lecture series</a> by Hugo Larochelle. 

- This is an excellent <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">book</a> that I personally started off with. I highly recommend working through the entire book for an intuitive understanding of how neural networks work.

- For focussed material on CNNs you can refer to <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/">CS231n</a> along with the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC">lectures</a> by Andrej Karpathy.
